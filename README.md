# RavePM

**RavePM** (Rave Package Manager) is a program that allows you to easily install libraries created using Rave.

## Dependencies
This program only needs a [**Rave**](https://github.com/Ttimofeyka/Rave) compiler and **git**.

## Testing
Let's say we are in a folder with a project. For installing [**RaveRaylib**](https://github.com/Ttimofeyka/RaveRaylib) you can use this command:

```
ravepm install RaveRaylib
```

Or this:

```
ravepm install https://github.com/Ttimofeyka/RaveRaylib
```

This repository contains a list of approved aliases to github repositories that allow you to install packages without specifying github.
